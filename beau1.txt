 Once, there was a rich merchant who had many ships.
 He bought and sold things from around would.
 He lived in a big house by the sea.
 He had three daughters.
 The daughters were all very beautiful, but the youngest
was the most beautiful of all.
 In fact, she was so beautiful that everyone called her
"beauty."
 Beauty was not only pretty but also kind and smart.
 She loved reading.
 Her two sisters were not very nice though.
 They were selfish and greed.
 They liked to go to parties and to wear nice dresses.
 they were always mean to Beauty.
 They laughed at her when she read books.
 They only thought about marrying rich men.
