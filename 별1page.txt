 i used to be a shepherd in the Luberon region of France.
 It was a very isolated place, so I was often all alone in the
pasture. Sometimes, I did not see many people for weeks.
 During those weeks, I only had my dog and the flocks of
sheep to accompany me.
 From time to time, I saw a loner who lived on Mount Lure.
 He would come down to hear some news of the outside would.
 Also I sometimes saw coal miners. They worked in the coal mines 
near my field, so I spoke with them as they went back and
 forth to the coal mines.
 Once erery two weeks, I got a visitor from the farm.
This person was usually the farm boy ro and old woman
 who worked at the farm.
